============
mo_installer
============

Help to install gettext mo file in a setuptools package.

Current status
--------------

This package is currently a work in progress (pre-alpha)

Goals
-----

`setuptools` has currently little support for `gettext` mo files generation and packaging. babel_ provides a nice integration, but is a rather large package. This intends to be a small package with examples in order to help developpers to smoothly integrate `gettext` internationlization in their packages.
